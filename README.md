# Python_EDA_and_Machine-Learning_Projects

This repository contains various Python EDA and Machine_Learning projects (based on various Machine Learning algorithm approaches as per the industry practices) done by me as a part of my learning and implementation of the various concepts in Python.



# Exploratory Data Visualization using Python

Your data is only as good as your ability to understand and communicate it, which is why **choosing the right visualization/chart is essential**. If you are unable to present the data effectively, key insights may be lost.

**Data Visualization** is a big part of a data scientist’s jobs. In the early stages of a project, we often do an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain some insights into data. Creating visualizations really helps make things clearer and easier to understand, especially with larger, high dimensional datasets. Towards the end of the project, it’s important to be able to present the final results in a clear, concise, and compelling manner that your audience, who are often non-technical clients, can understand.

### Here’s a great chart for selecting the right visualization for the job!

There are various packages available in Python for visualization purpose. Some of them are:​ **matplotlib, seaborn, bokeh​, plotly, ggplot, pygal, gleam, leather** etc. Each package has its own utility and which package to use depends mainly on the type of dataset, problem to solve and what you want to infer from it.

On the basis of the number of variables you want to see relationship in between, plotting can be classified as:

# Machine Learning Using Python

**What does Machine Learning really means?**  
Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.  
**Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs** that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.  
The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. **The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically** without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

Machine learning was defined in 90’s by **Arthur Samuel** described as **"It is a field of study that gives the ability to the computer for self-learn without being explicitly programmed”**, that means imbuing knowledge to machines without hard-coding it.


**Types of Machine Learning Algorithms**  : 
Machine Learning mainly divided into three categories, which are as follows:

 1. Unsupervised Learning
 2. Supervised Learning
 3. Reinforcement Learning
